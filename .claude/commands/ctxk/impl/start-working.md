## Description
Begin systematic development with context-aware setup, task analysis, and guided implementation initiation based on completed planning phases.

## Execution Flow (main)

### Phase 0: Check Customization

0. **Read the "👩‍💻 DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" section**
   - Use `Grep` tool to find the start of the section
   - Read everything below that line contained in this document til the end of the file
   - Make sure to consider what was said there with high priority
   - If anything conflicts with the rest of the workflow, prioritize the "developer customizations"

### Phase 1: Prerequisites & Feature Detection

1. **Detect Current Feature from Git Branch**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current || echo "⚠️ Not in git repository or no current branch"
   ```
   - If branch format is `feature/[prefix]-[kebab-case-name]`:
     - Extract full name from branch (e.g., `feature/001-visionos26-modernization` → `001-visionos26-modernization`)
     - Set FEATURE_NAME variable for directory matching
   - If not on feature branch:
     - Display warning in chat:
       ```
       ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
       ⚠️ WARNING - Not on Feature Branch
       ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

       Current branch: [current_branch_name]
       Expected: feature/[prefix]-[feature-name] branch from /ctxk:plan:1-spec

       Switch to feature branch or create one with /ctxk:plan:1-spec

       ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
       ```
     - Use AskUserQuestion tool with these parameters:
       ```json
       {
         "questions": [
           {
             "question": "Continue development without being on a feature branch?",
             "header": "Branch?",
             "options": [
               {
                 "label": "No, stop",
                 "description": "Exit and switch to proper feature branch (recommended)"
               },
               {
                 "label": "Yes, continue",
                 "description": "Proceed anyway and specify feature name manually"
               }
             ],
             "multiSelect": false
           }
         ]
       }
       ```
     - Wait for user response
     - If user selects "No, stop": EXIT
     - If user selects "Yes, continue": Ask user to specify feature name manually via text input

2. **Validate Feature Planning Completion**
   - Use `Bash` tool to find numbered feature directory with flexible matching:
     ```bash
     # Try exact full name match first
     FEATURE_DIR=$(ls -d Context/Features/*/ | grep -i "[FEATURE_NAME]" | head -1)
     # If no match, try number-based matching (extract prefix number)
     if [[ -z "$FEATURE_DIR" ]]; then
       PREFIX=$(echo "[FEATURE_NAME]" | cut -d'-' -f1)
       FEATURE_DIR=$(ls -d Context/Features/${PREFIX}-*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1)
     fi
     ```
   - Expected format: `Context/Features/###-FeatureName/` (e.g., `001-VisionOS26Modernization/`)
   - Handles variations between prefixed kebab-case branch names and numbered PascalCase directory names
   - Use `Read` tool to check each required file exists and has content:
     ```bash
     ls -la [numbered-feature-directory]/Spec.md && echo "✅ Spec.md exists"
     ls -la [numbered-feature-directory]/Tech.md && echo "✅ Tech.md exists"
     ls -la [numbered-feature-directory]/Steps.md && echo "✅ Steps.md exists"
     ```
   - Use `Read` tool to verify Steps.md contains task breakdown (not empty placeholder)
   - If any file missing or empty:
     ```
     ❌ Feature planning incomplete!

     Missing or empty files detected:
     [List missing files]

     Complete the planning phases first:
     1. /ctxk:plan:1-spec - Business requirements (creates Spec.md)
     2. /ctxk:plan:2-research-tech - Technical planning: research and architecture (creates Tech.md)
     3. /ctxk:plan:3-steps - Implementation tasks (creates Steps.md)

     Cannot proceed with development until planning is complete.
     ```
     → END (exit with error)

### Phase 2: Context Loading & Environment Setup

3. **Load Development Context**
   - Use `Read` tool to read project Context.md: `Read Context.md`
   - **DEEP ANALYSIS REQUIRED**: Understand project type, architecture patterns, coding standards, and constitutional principles
   - Use `Bash` tool to check for workspace context:
     ```bash
     cd .. && find . -name "Context.md" -path "*/Context.md" | head -1 || echo "No workspace context found"
     ```
   - If workspace Context.md found: Use `Read` tool to load workspace-specific overrides
   - **CRITICAL**: This context forms the foundation for understanding how to execute all Steps.md tasks

4. **Verify Development Environment**
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain || echo "⚠️ Git not available"
   ```
   - If uncommitted changes exist:
     - Display warning in chat:
       ```
       ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
       ⚠️ WARNING - Uncommitted Changes Detected
       ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

       You have uncommitted work that might be overwritten during development.
       Commit or stash changes before starting new development work.

       ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
       ```
     - Use AskUserQuestion tool with these parameters:
       ```json
       {
         "questions": [
           {
             "question": "Continue with uncommitted changes in working directory?",
             "header": "Git Changes",
             "options": [
               {
                 "label": "No, commit first",
                 "description": "Exit and commit/stash changes before starting (recommended)"
               },
               {
                 "label": "Yes, continue",
                 "description": "Proceed anyway with uncommitted changes present"
               }
             ],
             "multiSelect": false
           }
         ]
       }
       ```
     - Wait for user response
     - If user selects "No, commit first": EXIT (recommend committing/stashing)
     - If user selects "Yes, continue": Continue with warning logged


### Phase 3: Steps.md-Driven Development Execution

5. **Load Complete Feature Context - DEEP UNDERSTANDING REQUIRED**
   - Use `Read` tool to read all planning files for complete understanding:
     ```
     Read [numbered-feature-directory]/Spec.md       # Business requirements and user stories
     Read [numbered-feature-directory]/Tech.md       # Technical planning: research findings and architecture decisions
     Read [numbered-feature-directory]/Steps.md      # PRIMARY TASK LIST - Implementation breakdown
     ```
   - **CRITICAL - DEEP ANALYSIS REQUIRED**:
     - **From Spec.md**: Fully understand feature purpose, ALL user stories, ALL acceptance criteria, user experience requirements
     - **From Tech.md**: Thoroughly understand research findings (technologies, APIs, patterns), architecture decisions, technology choices, ALL constraints, design patterns
     - **From Steps.md**: **THIS IS THE PRIMARY TASK LIST** - Parse ALL S001-S999 numbered tasks, [P] parallel markers, dependencies, file paths, acceptance criteria
   - **Parse Steps.md as Primary Task List**:
     - Identify ALL tasks with their exact S### numbers
     - Parse completion status (checked/unchecked boxes) for each task
     - Extract dependencies for each task
     - Note which tasks have [P] parallel markers
     - Extract file paths and specific requirements for each task

6. **Execute Steps.md Tasks Sequentially - NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED**
   - **PRIMARY OBJECTIVE**: Follow Steps.md step-by-step as the definitive task list
   - Find the **first uncompleted task** in S001, S002, S003... sequence from Steps.md
   - **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Do NOT skip tasks, do NOT choose "easier" tasks, do NOT take shortcuts
   - **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Do NOT assume tasks are complete - follow the plan exactly
   - Check dependencies are satisfied:
     - Extract "Dependencies: S001, S002" from task description in Steps.md
     - Verify all dependency tasks are completed (checked boxes in Steps.md)
     - If dependencies not met: Display which specific tasks need completion first
   - **CRITICAL RULE**: Steps.md is the master plan - follow it religiously, never deviate
   - **NEVER SPEED UP**: Do NOT execute multiple steps at once - handle ONE task at a time
   - **NEVER ASSUME**: Do NOT assume tasks are simple or can be batched - follow each step individually
   - **NEVER AUTOMATE THE PROCESS**: Each step requires individual attention and execution
   - If no valid next task available: Display completion status and guide user to next phase
   - **Steps.md drives everything** - it's not just a reference, it's the execution plan

   **🚨 CRITICAL: TOKEN LIMITS ARE IRRELEVANT**
   - **NEVER optimize for token limits** - quality and thoroughness are paramount
   - **NEVER rush through steps** to fit within a session - take the time each step needs
   - **Session boundaries don't matter** - progress is tracked in Steps.md
   - **Just ignore token limit concerns** - continue working methodically
   - If context usage exceeds 80%: Pause and suggest user runs `/compact` before continuing
   - If session ends due to token limit: User can easily resume (Steps.md has all progress)
   - The entire workflow is designed to be resumable across multiple sessions
   - **Each step deserves proper attention** - never sacrifice quality for speed

7. **Execute Current Task from Steps.md - Follow the Plan Exactly**

   **CRITICAL**: The current task comes directly from Steps.md - execute exactly as specified, no shortcuts

   **For MANUAL REQUIRED Tasks** (marked with ⚠️ MANUAL REQUIRED in Steps.md):

   - Display manual task details in chat:
     ```
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

     Please complete this manual task exactly as specified, then return here.

     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
     ```
   - Use AskUserQuestion tool with these parameters:
     ```json
     {
       "questions": [
         {
           "question": "Manual task [TaskNumber] status? ([Task description from Steps.md])",
           "header": "Manual Task",
           "options": [
             {
               "label": "Done",
               "description": "I completed the manual task (will mark as ✅ in Steps.md)"
             },
             {
               "label": "Skip for now",
               "description": "Skip this task temporarily (breaks planned sequence)"
             },
             {
               "label": "Show details",
               "description": "Show more detailed instructions from Steps.md"
             },
             {
               "label": "Back to list",
               "description": "Return to task selection menu"
             }
           ],
           "multiSelect": false
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Wait for user response and process accordingly

   **For AUTOMATED Tasks** (no manual markers in Steps.md):

   **CRITICAL**: Execute exactly as specified in Steps.md - no shortcuts or assumptions

   - Display automated task details in chat:
     ```
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

     🔧 IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
     [How this will be implemented based on complete context understanding]

     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
     ```
   - Use AskUserQuestion tool with these parameters:
     ```json
     {
       "questions": [
         {
           "question": "Ready to execute automated task [TaskNumber]? ([Task description from Steps.md])",
           "header": "Execute?",
           "options": [
             {
               "label": "Yes, execute",
               "description": "Proceed with implementing this task from Steps.md"
             },
             {
               "label": "Wait, clarify",
               "description": "Need clarification before executing (emphasize Steps.md must be followed)"
             }
           ],
           "multiSelect": false
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Wait for user response

   **IMPORTANT**:
   - Task details come DIRECTLY from Steps.md - never modify or interpret
   - Use complete context from Spec.md and Tech.md (which contains research + architecture) for implementation
   - Do NOT skip steps or take shortcuts - follow Steps.md exactly
   - If user selects "Wait, clarify": Provide clarification but emphasize Steps.md must be followed

### Phase 4: Task Execution with Steps.md as Central Progress Tracker

8. **Execute Task Implementation with Complete Context**
   - **For Manual Tasks**: User delegation complete, immediately mark as done in Steps.md
   - **For Automated Tasks**: Implement using complete context understanding:
     - **Use ALL context from planning files**: Apply complete understanding from Spec.md and Tech.md (research + architecture)
     - Extract detailed task information from Steps.md: file paths, acceptance criteria, dependencies
     - Use `Read` tool to examine target files if they exist
     - Use `Glob` tool to discover available guidelines: `Glob Context/Guidelines *.md`
     - For each found guideline file, use `Read` tool to load and apply content
     - Apply constitutional principles relevant to task type (UI, models, services, etc.)
     - **Execute exactly as planned in Steps.md** - no shortcuts, no assumptions
     - Ensure implementation meets all criteria specified in Steps.md

9. **Update Steps.md Progress Tracking - CENTRAL TO WORKFLOW**
    - **IMMEDIATELY after task completion**: Use `Edit` tool to mark completed task as checked in Steps.md:
      ```
      OLD: - [ ] **S001** [task description]
      NEW: - [x] **S001** [task description]
      ```
    - **Add completion timestamp**: Update task notes with completion time
    - **🚨 CRITICAL**: Steps.md is THE authoritative progress tracker
    - **Even if using TodoWrite**: Steps.md is the real source of truth, not the todo list
    - TodoWrite is just for temporary session tracking - Steps.md persists across all sessions
    - Verify the checkbox update was successful before proceeding
    - **This enables session continuity**: Any new session can resume by reading Steps.md

10. **Continue Sequential Execution - No Exit Until All Done**
    - **IMMEDIATELY after updating Steps.md**: Check for next sequential task
    - **Do NOT exit** - continue with next task in sequence according to Steps.md
    - Display progress update based on Steps.md status:
    ```
    ✅ Task [TaskNumber] completed and marked in Steps.md!

    📊 Progress: [completed_tasks+1]/[total_tasks] tasks done per Steps.md
    🔄 Loading next task from Steps.md...
    ```
    - Return to Phase 3, Step 6 to determine next task from Steps.md
    - **Only exit when**:
      - ALL Steps.md tasks completed (all checkboxes checked)
      - Dependency blocking prevents any task execution
      - User explicitly requests to stop
    - **The goal**: Complete the entire Steps.md task list systematically

11. **Quality Assurance Integration with Primary Agents**
    - **PRIMARY AGENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION**: Use these agents throughout development as specified in Steps.md
      - `build-project` - **Use whenever Steps.md mentions "build" or "compile"**
      - `commit-changes` - **Use at ALL milestone markers in Steps.md** (🏁 MILESTONE)
      - `run-test-suite` / `run-specific-test` - **Use when Steps.md specifies test execution**

    **Primary Agent Usage Examples**:
    ```
    # When Steps.md task says "build" or at Phase 5 validation tasks:
    Use Task tool with build-project:
    "Execute project build and report status."

    # At every 🏁 MILESTONE marker in Steps.md:
    Use Task tool with commit-changes:
    "Analyze changes and create commit for [milestone description]."
    (Agent handles all git analysis and commit message generation)

    # When Steps.md specifies test execution:
    Use Task tool with run-test-suite:
    "Execute complete test suite and report results."

    Use Task tool with run-specific-test:
    "Run tests for LoginViewModel and report failures."
    ```

    - **When to use build-project**:
      - After implementing significant functionality (service layer, UI components)
      - Before milestone commits to ensure code compiles
      - When Steps.md tasks explicitly mention "build validation"
      - After resolving dependency or integration issues

    - **When to use commit-changes agent**:
      - At EVERY 🏁 MILESTONE marker in Steps.md (use Task tool)
      - After completing a logical phase of work (data layer, UI layer, etc.)
      - When directed by Steps.md milestone instructions
      - The agent handles git analysis, formatting, and commit message generation
      - Users can also manually run /ctxk:impl:commit-changes command

    - **When to use run-test-* agents**:
      - When Steps.md Phase 5 tasks specify test execution
      - After implementing new test files
      - Before milestone commits when tests exist
      - When debugging failing tests

    - **Additional Quality Agents** (currently incomplete - pending rework):
      <!-- TODO: check-* agents disabled (need rework to read-only reporting)
      - `check-modern-code` - Modernize APIs (recent files only) [INCOMPLETE]
      - `check-error-handling` - Validate error patterns (recent files only) [INCOMPLETE]
      - `check-accessibility` - Check UI accessibility (recent UI files only) [INCOMPLETE]
      - `check-localization` - Verify localization (recent UI files only) [INCOMPLETE]
      - `check-code-debt` - Clean up artifacts (recent files only) [INCOMPLETE]
      -->

    - **If agents fail**: Focus on fixing the specific issue before continuing, then re-run the failed agent to verify the fix

## Error Conditions

- **"Not on feature branch"** → Create feature branch with `/ctxk:plan:1-spec` or switch to existing one
- **"Planning phases incomplete"** → Complete `/ctxk:plan:1-spec` (creates Spec.md), `/ctxk:plan:2-research-tech` (creates Tech.md), `/ctxk:plan:3-steps` (creates Steps.md) sequence
- **"No feature directory found"** → Feature name detection failed, verify branch name format
- **"Steps.md empty"** → Run `/ctxk:plan:3-steps` to create implementation breakdown
- **"Build environment broken"** → Resolve dependency issues before starting development
- **"All tasks complete"** → No pending work, consider `/ctxk:impl:commit-changes` or new feature


## Integration Points

- **Planning Commands**: Requires completed `/ctxk:plan:1-spec` (Spec.md), `/ctxk:plan:2-research-tech` (Tech.md with research + architecture), `/ctxk:plan:3-steps` (Steps.md) workflow
- **Project Setup**: Uses Context.md from `/ctxk:proj:init` for project type detection and standards
- **Quality Agents**: Integrates with `build-project`, `run-test-*` agents (ready). `/run check-*` agents incomplete - pending rework
- **Workspace Context**: Inherits client-specific requirements from workspace-level Context.md files
- **Git Workflow**: Works within feature branch structure established by planning commands
- **Development Hooks**: Enables PostToolUse formatting and SessionStart version checking
- **Task Tracking**: Updates Steps.md progress tracking for systematic development workflow
