# Quick Planning Workflow

This command creates a condensed, single-file plan for:
- Bug fixes
- Smaller feature additions
- Code improvements and refactoring
- Dependency updates
- Documentation updates
- Focused enhancements

**Note**: These tasks are smaller but substantial enough to need planning, just not the full multi-file workflow.

**Use the full workflow** (`/ctxk:plan:1-spec`, etc.) for:
- New major features
- Multiple component changes
- Unclear requirements requiring extensive research
- Tasks needing detailed technical architecture with separate research phase

---

## 🤖 Execution Instructions

### Phase 0: Check Customization

1. **Read developer customizations**
   - Use Grep to find "👩‍💻 DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" section in this file
   - Read everything below that line until end of file
   - Prioritize developer customizations if conflicts exist

### Phase 1: Setup Validation

2. **Check Project Setup**
   - Use Glob to verify `Context.md` exists: `Glob "Context.md"`
   - If missing: ERROR "Run /ctxk:proj:init first"
   - Stop execution if not initialized

### Phase 2: Capture User Intent

3. **Get Task Description from User**
   - Ask user to describe the task using standardized format:
   ```
   ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   📝 QUICK TASK - What needs to be done?
   ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Please describe the task, bug fix, or improvement:

   Examples:
   • "Fix the login button alignment on iPad"
   • "Add dark mode toggle to settings screen"
   • "Refactor AuthService to use async/await"
   • "Update SwiftUI dependencies to latest versions"

   Your description:
   ```
   - **WAIT for user response** (execution MUST stop)
   - **CRITICAL**: Store description exactly verbatim for Quick.md Input field
   - Do NOT summarize or paraphrase

### Phase 3: Codebase & Research Analysis

4. **Analyze Relevant Code and Context**
   - Use Grep to find relevant files and patterns:
     - Search for class/struct names mentioned in description
     - Search for function names or features mentioned
     - Find related test files
   - Use Read to examine relevant files (as many as needed for understanding)
   - Use Read to load project Context.md for patterns and architecture
   - **May include online research** if needed for understanding technologies or APIs
   - Extract:
     - Relevant file paths with line numbers
     - Current implementation patterns
     - Integration points and dependencies
     - Any research findings from documentation or resources
   - **Be thorough** - if the task needs ContextKit, it needs proper analysis

### Phase 4: Interactive Understanding Validation

5. **Present Understanding Summary to User**
   - Display understanding summary in chat (DO NOT create file yet):
     ```
     ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     📋 TASK UNDERSTANDING - Please Review & Confirm
     ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

     ## What I Understood

     [Summary of the task - as detailed as necessary for clarity]

     ## In Scope ✅

     - [Items that will be addressed]
     - [As many items as needed for clarity]

     ## Out of Scope ❌

     - [Related items that won't be addressed]
     - [Clearly defined boundaries]

     ## Potential Edge Cases 🔍

     - [Edge cases to consider]
     - [Boundary conditions to watch for]

     ## Questions/Clarifications ❓

     [Only if there are genuine uncertainties]

     ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     ```
   - Use AskUserQuestion tool with these parameters:
     ```json
     {
       "questions": [
         {
           "question": "Does this understanding match your intent for the task?",
           "header": "Confirm?",
           "options": [
             {
               "label": "Yes, proceed",
               "description": "Understanding is correct, create the quick plan file"
             },
             {
               "label": "No, adjust",
               "description": "Provide corrections to update the understanding"
             },
             {
               "label": "Show details",
               "description": "Show more detailed codebase analysis findings first"
             }
           ],
           "multiSelect": false
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Wait for user response
   - If user selects "No, adjust":
     - Accept corrections via "Other" option text input
     - Update understanding based on feedback
     - Present revised understanding
     - Ask confirmation question again
   - If user selects "Show details":
     - Display detailed codebase analysis findings
     - Present understanding summary again
     - Ask confirmation question again
   - Continue only after user selects "Yes, proceed"

### Phase 5: Generate Quick Plan File

6. **Generate Sequential Number & Create File**
   ```bash
   # Count existing items in Context/Features/ (both folders and files)
   NEXT_NUM=$(printf "%03d" $(($(ls -1 Context/Features/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l) + 1)))
   ```

7. **Generate Task Name from Description**
   - Parse user description for key concepts
   - Create UpperCamelCase name (e.g., "FixLoginButtonAlignment")
   - Keep concise: 2-4 words maximum
   - Focus on action and subject

8. **Copy Quick Template**
   ```bash
   cp ~/.ContextKit/Templates/Features/Quick.md Context/Features/${NEXT_NUM}-[TaskName].md
   ```

9. **Execute Quick Template Workflow**
   - Use Read to read the newly copied Quick.md file
   - Use Edit to populate all sections:
     - **Header**: Replace `[TaskName]` with generated name
     - **Input**: User's verbatim description (use triple quotes)
     - **Understanding**: Confirmed summary from interactive validation (as detailed as needed)
     - **In Scope**: Items from validated understanding (as many as needed for clarity)
     - **Out of Scope**: Items from validated understanding (clearly define boundaries)
     - **Edge Cases**: Items from validated understanding (all relevant considerations)
     - **Code Context**: File paths, patterns, integration points
       - **If online research WAS conducted**: Populate Research Sources subsection with URLs, versions, dates
       - **If NO online research was needed**: Remove Research Sources subsection entirely
     - **Implementation Approach**: Detailed technical approach with rationale and research
     - **Tasks**: Generate specific actionable tasks (as many as needed)
   - Use Edit to remove entire boxed system instructions section
   - Verify all placeholder text replaced

10. **Display Success Message**
    ```
