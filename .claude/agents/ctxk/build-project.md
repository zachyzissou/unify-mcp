## Purpose

Execute project builds and report build status with clean, actionable error and warning summaries. Filter out verbose build output and developer comment warnings while preserving critical compilation issues.

## Execution Flow (agent)

0. **Read the "👩‍💻 DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" section**
   - Use `Grep` tool to find the start of the section
   - Read everything below that line contained in this document til the end of the file
   - Make sure to consider what was said there with high priority
   - If anything conflicts with the rest of the workflow, prioritize the "developer customizations"

1. **Read Project Context First**
   - Use `Read` tool to examine `Context.md` file in project root
   - Look for build instructions section or build command documentation
   - Extract documented build command if present
   - If Context.md missing or no build info: proceed to auto-detection

2. **Auto-Detect Project Type** (fallback only)
   - Use `Glob` to search for project indicators: `Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`
   - Determine build system and appropriate build command
   - If no recognizable project structure: ERROR "Unable to detect project build system"

3. **Execute Build Command**
   - **From Context.md**: Use documented build command exactly as specified
   - **Swift Package**: `swift build` (add `--quiet` to reduce output)
   - **Xcode Project**: `xcodebuild -scheme [detected-scheme] build -quiet` or `xcodebuild -scheme App -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17" build -quiet`
   - **npm Project**: `npm run build` or `npm install` if no build script
   - **Python**: `python -m build` or `pip install -e .`
   - **Other**: Report unsupported project type with detected files
   - Capture both stdout and stderr from build process

4. **Filter Build Output**
   - **Remove verbose output**: Progress indicators, successful file compilations, verbose tool output
   - **Keep critical errors**: Compilation failures, missing dependencies, syntax errors
   - **Filter developer comment warnings**: Remove warnings about comments like "TODO:", "FIXME:", "NOTE:"
   - **Keep actionable warnings**: Unused variables, deprecated APIs, performance warnings
   - **Preserve error context**: Include file paths, line numbers, and specific error descriptions

5. **Generate Build Report**
   - **SUCCESS**: Brief summary with any warnings that need attention
   - **FAILURE**: List critical errors with file locations and suggested fixes
   - **PARTIAL**: Note mixed results with both successful and failed components
   - Include overall build time and status
   - **If auto-detected build**: Add Context.md documentation suggestion

6. **Return Status**
   - SUCCESS: Build completed without critical errors
   - FAILURE: Build failed with actionable error report
   - ERROR: Unable to execute build (missing tools, invalid project)

## Build Output Filtering Patterns

### Remove These Patterns (Noise)
- Progress indicators: "Compiling...", "Building...", percentage completion
- Successful compilations: "✓ Compiled successfully"
- Verbose dependency resolution output
- Developer comment warnings containing: "TODO", "FIXME", "NOTE", "HACK"
- Build timing information unless build failed

### Keep These Patterns (Critical)
- **Error keywords**: "error:", "fatal:", "failed", "cannot"
- **Warning keywords**: "warning:", "deprecated", "unused", "performance"
- **File references**: Paths and line numbers with issues
- **Missing dependencies**: "not found", "missing", "unresolved"
- **Syntax errors**: Parser failures, invalid syntax
- **Type errors**: Type mismatches, undefined symbols

### Extract Context Information
- **File paths**: Full paths to files with issues
- **Line numbers**: Specific locations of problems
- **Error codes**: Compiler error numbers when available
- **Suggested fixes**: When compiler provides suggestions

## Build Report Format

### Success Report
```
BUILD SUCCESS ✅
Duration: [time]
Warnings: [count] (filtered [count] developer comments)

[List any actionable warnings with file:line references]

Status: Ready for next development phase
```

### Success Report (Auto-Detected Build)
```
BUILD SUCCESS ✅
Duration: [time]
Warnings: [count] (filtered [count] developer comments)
Build Command: [detected command]

[List any actionable warnings with file:line references]

⚠️  CONTEXT.MD UPDATE RECOMMENDED
Add this to your Context.md file for faster future builds:

## Build Instructions
```
[detected-build-command]
```

Status: Ready for next development phase
```

### Failure Report
```
BUILD FAILED ❌
Duration: [time]
Errors: [count]

CRITICAL ERRORS:
[List each error with file:line and description]

ACTIONABLE WARNINGS:
[List warnings that should be addressed]

Next Steps:
- Fix compilation errors in [files]
- Address [specific warning types]
- Re-run build after fixes
```

### Error Report (Build System Issues)
```
BUILD ERROR ⚠️
Issue: [Specific problem - missing tools, invalid config, etc.]

Resolution:
- [Specific steps to fix the build environment]
```

## Context.md Build Instruction Examples

When reading Context.md, look for these common build instruction patterns:

### Swift Package Projects
```markdown
## Build Instructions
swift build
```
or
```markdown
## Build Instructions
swift build --quiet
```

### Xcode Projects
```markdown
## Build Instructions
xcodebuild -scheme App build -quiet
```
or
```markdown
## Build Instructions
xcodebuild -scheme MyAppScheme -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17" build
```

### Multi-Command Builds
```markdown
## Build Instructions
swift package resolve
swift build
```

## Project Type Detection (Fallback)

### Swift Projects
- **Indicators**: `Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`
- **Build commands**: `swift build`, `xcodebuild -scheme App build -quiet`
- **Common issues**: Missing dependencies, Swift version conflicts

### JavaScript/Node Projects
- **Indicators**: `package.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `yarn.lock`
- **Build commands**: `npm run build`, `yarn build`, `npm install`
- **Common issues**: Missing node_modules, version conflicts

### Python Projects
- **Indicators**: `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`
- **Build commands**: `python -m build`, `pip install -e .`
- **Common issues**: Missing dependencies, Python version issues

### Other Project Types
- Detect and report project type
- Provide guidance on adding build support
- Suggest manual build commands if automated detection fails

## Error Recovery Guidance

### Common Build Failures
- **Missing dependencies**: Suggest `swift package resolve`, `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Tool version issues**: Report detected versions vs required versions
- **Configuration errors**: Point to common config file issues
- **Permission problems**: Suggest file permission fixes

### Build Environment Issues
- **Missing build tools**: Provide installation guidance
- **Path issues**: Suggest PATH configuration fixes
- **Platform compatibility**: Report macOS/Linux/Windows specific issues
