## Purpose
Analyze current git changes comprehensively, understand both the 'what' and 'why' of modifications, generate intelligent commit messages following strict format requirements, execute the commit, and provide a clear summary of the committed changes.

## Context Requirements
- Git repository with staged or unstaged changes
- Optional project Context.md file for understanding project patterns
- Code formatting configuration files (.swiftformat, .swift-format) if present
- Write access to repository for commit execution

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Git Repository Analysis
- Verify git repository state and detect conflicts
- Analyze all staged and unstaged changes using `git diff` and `git status`
- Understand file types, change patterns, and modification scope
- Identify the purpose and context behind the changes

### 2. Intelligent Commit Message Generation
Generate commit messages that follow these **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:

#### Format Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- **Length**: 50 characters maximum (extend to 72 only if absolutely necessary)
- **Style**: Imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- **Capitalization**: First word capitalized, no period at end
- **Single Line**: Never use multi-line commits or body paragraphs
- **Content Focus**: Functionality and purpose, NEVER mention formatting
- **AI Attribution**: **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** - no AI mentions, Claude references, emoji, or co-authorship

#### Common Action Verbs (examples, not exhaustive)
- **Add**: New functionality, files, or features
- **Fix**: Bug fixes and error corrections
- **Update**: Modifications to existing functionality
- **Remove**: Deletion of code, files, or features
- **Improve**: Performance, readability, or architectural enhancements
- **Configure**: Settings, build configurations, project setup
- **Optimize**: Performance improvements
- **Migrate**: Moving from one system/approach to another
- **Refactor**: Code restructuring without changing functionality
- **Document**: Documentation additions or updates

**Note**: Choose whatever verb best describes the semantic meaning of the changes. These are common patterns, but use your judgment for the clearest, most accurate description.

#### Context-Driven Analysis
Understand WHY changes were made, not just WHAT changed:
- **Bug fixes**: "Fix [specific issue/symptom]"
- **Feature addition**: "Add [feature name with brief context]"
- **Refactoring**: "Improve [component/area]" or "Refactor [system]"
- **Configuration**: "Configure [tool/setting/capability]"
- **Dependencies**: "Update dependencies" or "Add [package] dependency"
- **Performance**: "Optimize [specific area/component]"
- **Testing**: "Add tests for [feature/component]"
- **Migration**: "Migrate [from X to Y]"
- **Cleanup**: "Remove unused [items]" or "Clean up [area]"

#### Examples of Quality Messages
```
Good examples:
"Add user authentication with biometric support"
"Fix memory leak in image caching system"
"Update privacy manifest for location services"
"Configure WidgetKit capabilities for visionOS"
"Optimize SwiftUI view rendering performance"
"Remove deprecated networking layer"
"Migrate Date() to Date.now API"

Avoid these patterns:
"Added user authentication" (wrong tense)
"fix memory leak" (not capitalized)
"Update formatting and add feature" (mentions formatting)
"🤖 Add feature" (emoji forbidden)
```

### 3. Code Formatting (Optional)
- Apply SwiftFormat and swift-format if configuration files exist
- Handle other formatters based on project configuration
- Skip formatting if configs not present (don't fail)

### 4. Commit Execution & Validation
- Stage all changes with `git add .`
- Execute commit with generated message
- Verify commit format using `git log -1 --format="%s%n%b"`
- Fix format violations with `git commit --amend` if needed
- Validate no AI attribution or multi-line format exists

## Execution Flow (agent)
0. **Read the "👩‍💻 DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" section**
   - Use `Grep` tool to find the start of the section
   - Read everything below that line contained in this document til the end of the file
   - Make sure to consider what was said there with high priority
   - If anything conflicts with the rest of the workflow, prioritize the "developer customizations"

1. **Single Git Analysis**
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD  # Get ALL changes (staged + unstaged) with full context
   ```
   - If no output: Exit with error "No changes to commit"
   - If merge conflict markers detected: Exit with error "Resolve merge conflicts first"
   - Analyze the semantic meaning of changes from full diff content
   - Understand the purpose and scope of modifications
   - Identify primary change theme (feature, fix, refactor, etc.)

2. **Optional Formatting**
   ```bash
   test -f .swiftformat && swiftformat . --config .swiftformat
   test -f .swift-format && swift-format --in-place --recursive Sources/
   ```

3. **Commit Message Generation**
   - Apply context-driven analysis to understand WHY changes were made
   - Select appropriate action verb based on change type and purpose
   - Craft message following all format requirements
   - Ensure message captures both WHAT and WHY of the changes

4. **Commit Execution**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "[GENERATED_MESSAGE]"
   ```

5. **Post-Commit Validation**
   ```bash
   git log -1 --format="%s%n%b"
   ```
   - Verify single line format with no body
   - Check for any AI attribution violations
   - Amend commit if format issues detected

## Response Format

**CRITICAL**: Output ONLY the format below. Do NOT add any additional text, explanations, summaries, or commentary before or after this format.

### Success Response
Output EXACTLY this format with NO additional text:

```
✅ Successfully committed changes

📝 Commit: [commit_hash]
💬 Message: "[commit_message]"
📂 Files: [number] files modified
📊 Changes: +[lines_added] -[lines_deleted]
```

### Error Response
Output EXACTLY this format with NO additional text:

```
❌ Commit failed: [reason]

🔧 Resolution: [specific steps to fix the issue]
```

**FORBIDDEN**: Do NOT add preamble like "I'll commit these changes" or postamble like "The commit has been completed successfully"

## Error Handling

- **No changes**: "No changes to commit. Stage files or make modifications first."
- **Merge conflicts**: "Resolve merge conflicts before committing. Use `git status` to see conflicted files."
- **Not in git repo**: "Not in a git repository. Initialize with `git init` or navigate to a git project."
- **Format violations**: Automatically fix with `git commit --amend`
- **Permission errors**: "Check repository write permissions."

## Quality Assurance

- Never generate multi-line commits or body text
- Never include AI attribution, emoji, or Claude references
- Always use imperative mood and proper capitalization
- Focus on functionality and business value, not implementation details
- Validate commit format post-execution and fix automatically
