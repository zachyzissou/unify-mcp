**Purpose**: Execute complete test suite with build validation and structured reporting focused on actionable test results.

**Context Requirements**:
- Project test files and configuration
- Test framework setup (XCTest, Swift Testing, etc.)
- Target platform configuration

## Execution Flow (agent)

0. **Read the "👩‍💻 DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" section**
   - Use `Grep` tool to find the start of the section
   - Read everything below that line contained in this document til the end of the file
   - Make sure to consider what was said there with high priority
   - If anything conflicts with the rest of the workflow, prioritize the "developer customizations"

1. **Read Project Context**
   → Use Read tool to examine Context.md file in project root
   → Extract project type, architecture, and test configuration details
   → Look for test-specific instructions or requirements
   → If Context.md missing: proceed with auto-detection

2. **Detect Project Type and Test Framework**
   → Use Glob to find project indicators and test targets
   → Look for Xcode test plans (*.xctestplan files) for organized test execution
   → Identify test framework from project structure and dependencies
   → Locate test targets and test files based on project type
   → If no tests found: WARN "No test targets detected - recommend adding tests"

3. **Check Build Status**
   → If `build-project` agent recently succeeded: Skip build verification
   → Otherwise: Attempt quick test target build validation
   → If build fails: ERROR "Test build failed" + return specific build errors
   → Continue only if build succeeds

4. **Execute Test Suite**
   → Use test plans when available for organized execution
   → For Swift Package: Run `swift test --parallel` for faster unit test execution
   → For iOS/macOS App: Use `xcodebuild test` with test plan or scheme
   → Capture all test output for parsing
   → Report progress for long-running test suites

5. **Parse Test Results**
   → Extract total test count, passed count, failed count, skipped count
   → Identify specific failing tests with error messages
   → Extract test execution duration
   → Parse any performance test results if present

6. **Generate Test Report**
   → Provide overall test status (PASSED/FAILED) with counts
   → List failed tests with specific error messages and file locations
   → Include test execution duration
   → Return SUCCESS with summary or FAILURE with actionable details

## Output Format

### Successful Test Run
```
✅ TEST SUITE PASSED

**Results**: 45/45 tests passed
**Duration**: 12.3 seconds

All tests completed successfully.
```

### Failed Test Run
```
❌ TEST SUITE FAILED

**Results**: 42/45 tests passed (3 failed)
**Duration**: 8.7 seconds

## Failed Tests

**UserModelTests.testEmailValidation** (Tests/UserModelTests.swift:23)
- XCTAssertTrue failed: Expected valid email validation
- Fix: Check email validation logic in Models/User.swift

**SettingsViewModelTests.testToggleFeature** (Tests/SettingsViewModelTests.swift:45)
- XCTAssertEqual failed: Expected true, got false
- Fix: Verify feature toggle state management in ViewModels/SettingsViewModel.swift

**LoginViewUITests.testLoginFlow** (UITests/LoginViewUITests.swift:12)
- Element query failed: Button with identifier "loginButton" not found
- Fix: Add accessibility identifier to Login button in Views/LoginView.swift

## Recommendations
- Fix email validation logic in User model
- Review feature toggle state management in SettingsViewModel
- Add missing accessibility identifiers to SwiftUI views
```

## Project Type Detection

Use Context.md information when available, otherwise detect from project structure:

**Swift Package Projects**:
- Look for Package.swift file in project root
- Use `swift test --parallel` for optimal unit test performance
- Parse XCTest output for test results and failures

**iOS/macOS App Projects**:
- Look for *.xcodeproj or *.xcworkspace files and *.xctestplan files
- Use test plans when available: `xcodebuild test -testPlan TestPlan`
- Otherwise use scheme-based testing: `xcodebuild test -scheme App`
- Parse xcodebuild test output for results

**Example SwiftUI Test Output Patterns**:
```
Test Suite 'All tests' started
Test Case '-[MyAppTests.UserModelTests testEmailValidation]' started.
Test Case '-[MyAppTests.UserModelTests testEmailValidation]' failed (0.001 seconds).
Testing failed:
    UserModelTests.swift:23: XCTAssertTrue failed - Invalid email should be rejected
```

## Validation Gates

- [ ] Project builds successfully before running tests?
- [ ] Test framework properly configured and accessible?
- [ ] Test execution completes without infrastructure failures?
- [ ] Results properly parsed and categorized?
- [ ] Actionable failure details provided?

## Error Conditions

- **"Test build failed"** → Fix compilation errors before running tests
- **"No tests found"** → Add test targets or verify test discovery configuration
- **"Test execution timeout"** → Check for hanging tests or increase timeout limits
- **"Test framework not configured"** → Verify test dependencies and setup

**Common SwiftUI Testing Issues**:
- Missing accessibility identifiers for UI testing
- XCTest framework not properly imported in test files
- Test target not properly configured in Xcode project
- SwiftUI view state not properly isolated in tests

## Integration with ContextKit Workflow

**Used by Implementation Commands**:
- `/ctxk:impl:start-working` can validate current test status
- Quality validation before feature completion

**Works with Other Agents**:
- Optimized to run after `build-project` agent (skips redundant build verification)
- Complements `run-specific-test` agent for focused debugging
- Provides validation before release workflows

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Uses parallel execution for Swift package unit tests (`--parallel` flag)
- Leverages Xcode test plans for organized and efficient test execution
- Reports progress during long test runs to maintain development flow
